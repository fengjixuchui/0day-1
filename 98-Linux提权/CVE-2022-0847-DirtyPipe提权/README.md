# Linux Kernel 5.8 < 5.16.11 - Local Privilege Escalation (DirtyPipe)

## 漏洞描述
漏洞类似于 脏牛：CVE-2016-5195 “Dirty Cow”，但是更加容易利用

## 提权限制
1. the attacker must have read permissions (because it needs to splice() a page into a pipe)
2. the offset must not be on a page boundary (because at least one byte of that page must have been spliced into the pipe)
3. the write cannot cross a page boundary (because a new anonymous buffer would be created for the rest)
4. the file cannot be resized (because the pipe has its own page fill management and does not tell the page cache how much data has been appended)

## 使用方法
```shell
bash exploit.sh

```
